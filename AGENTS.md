# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Datalize

**`CLAUDE.md` is the source of truth for this repo.** Read it first — it carries the agent brief,
doc precedence, the non-negotiable invariants, the folder map, and the commands.

This file exists only because the Next.js toolchain writes the block above into it, and because a
different model and harness reads `AGENTS.md`. Do not duplicate the brief here; anything that belongs
to every agent belongs in `CLAUDE.md`. Each folder under `src/` carries its own `CLAUDE.md` with the
rules for that folder.
